# My Reading Journal
Hello everyone My name is Da'Shawn White.

## What growth mindset means to me:

> To me growth mindset is not just a way of making it through the work day. It should also be viewed as a way of thinking in every day life. 
You should utilize a growth mindset to overcome a negative view of your day and turn it into a positive. You're seeing everything as a reason to progress and grow in life, instead of hindering your from reaching your goal(s).

## 3 Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:

> 1. Realize that everything you enconter that seems to be hindering you, can actually help you grow.
> 2. Failure is just an opportunity for growth.
> 3. Allow others' succes to be a foundation for your path.
