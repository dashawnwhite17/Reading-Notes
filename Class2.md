# Class 2 Reading Assignment
### Four important features in a text editor
> 1. ***Code Completion***
>   - Code completion allows one to start typing and will display suggestions based off of what you originally typed.
> 2. ***Syntax Highligting***
>   - This feature takes what you type and makes it more appealing and noticeable by adding color to the text.
> 3. ***Themes***
>   * Allows the user to change the color of the background of the text editor, series of colors in your text. Web developers normally use darkerbackgrounds and colorful text due to it being less strenious on the eyes.
> 4. ***Extensions***
>   * Extensions are just like add-ons for your text editor. They give you the ability to access more and create more functionalities that you otherwise would not be able to do. Compare them to purchasing a new DLC pack for your video games. Without a certain dlc pack, you can not play certain maps or unlock certain characters. 

### Functions of the following commands:
> ***PWD(Print Working Directory):*** This tells you what your current working directory is.
> 
> ***LS(list):*** What's in your current location (List the contents of a Directory).
> 
> ***CD(Change Directory):*** How to move from one directory to the next.  
>   * Directories only contain informaton needed to access files or other directories.
>   
>   ***MKDIR(Make Directories):*** Creates new empty directores whose name is defined by path.
>   * A Path is a string of characters used to identify a specific location within a directory.

### The following scenario ###
 1. cd projects
 2. mkdir new-project
 3. touch new-project/newfile.md
 4. cd ..
  5. Ls projects/new-project

> Line 1. The user is changing directories to projects
> 
>Line 2. The user is making a new file, naming it "new-project" within the projects directory.
> 
> Line 3. The user is now either modifying the access or modification time to reflect a timeframe that they need.
> 
> Line 4. The user is changing their directory to the home directory.
> 
> Line 5. Now that the user has went back to the home directory, they're running the Ls(list) command to see what contents are within that current directory.
