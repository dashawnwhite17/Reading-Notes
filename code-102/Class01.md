## Notes:

Being one of the worlds most popular markup languages, Markdown is a lightweight language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Markdown is different than a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor. These editors, like MS word, have immediate changes just at the click of a button. Like when you format your sentences using bullet points, or creating a bold lettering by pressing "ctrl + b".
Whereas, in a Markdown file, you add Markdown syntax. Using symbols like an Asterisk(*) to **bold** or *italicize* your phrase. You may not see it, but by putting two asterisk markers before and after the word 'bold' I was able to make the word bold itself. And by putting one asterisk mark before and after the word 'italicize', I was able to make the word italic. 

If I use the Hash Sign I can create a heading. But there's a specific way to do so. When creating a heading you have to space your hash sign from your initial heading 
(# Heading). And after that you must leave a line unedited between your heading and any following text. There's different levels to the headings. Different sizes if you will. 
Level 1, which is a single hash sign, level 2 which is two hash signs, all the way up to level 6; which would obviously be 6 hash signs. So if you wanted to make your heading the biggest, you would use your level 1. And if you wanted to make it your smallest you would use your level 6. 

We use markdown for a variety of different reasons:
1. It's transferable
2. It's solely dependent on a platform
3. If your application that supports Markdown-formatted text no longer works, you can use a text editing application E.g., Sublime Text to read your formatted text.
4. And it is pretty much everywhere.
